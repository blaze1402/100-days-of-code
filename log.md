# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tsunami Alert app to learn about networking and getting responses from a JSON API from USGS.

**Thoughts:** I really didn't knew how to connect a app to internet and get information from other sources, I started learning about APIs and made a mini project to understand the basics of getting a response from a JSON API. I think I'm getting better at it now.

### Day 2: April 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made many networking changes to the QuakeReport App which works through the API of USGS and added background thread for HTTP requests and updated the UI a bit for better responsiveness and error handling. 

**Thoughts** It was difficult to apply the AsyncTaskLoader for better efficiency of the App. Need a bit more practice with APIs and multithreaded processes.
