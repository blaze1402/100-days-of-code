# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tsunami Alert app to learn about networking and getting responses from a JSON API from USGS.

**Thoughts:** I really didn't knew how to connect a app to internet and get information from other sources, I started learning about APIs and made a mini project to understand the basics of getting a response from a JSON API. I think I'm getting better at it now.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
