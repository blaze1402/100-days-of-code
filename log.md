# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tsunami Alert app to learn about networking and getting responses from a JSON API from USGS.

**Thoughts:** I really didn't knew how to connect a app to internet and get information from other sources, I started learning about APIs and made a mini project to understand the basics of getting a response from a JSON API. I think I'm getting better at it now.

### Day 1: April 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a Did you feel it? App which tells the estimate of how many people felt the recent Earthquake from USGS API.

**Thoughts** It was fun learning the concepts of networking and APIs. Now I can use this knowledge on my other app.

### Day 2: April 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made many networking changes to the QuakeReport App which works through the API of USGS and added background thread for HTTP requests and updated the UI a bit for better responsiveness and error handling. 

**Thoughts** It was difficult to apply the AsyncTaskLoader for better efficiency of the App. Need a bit more practice with APIs and multithreaded processes.

**Today's Progress**: Trying to add a preference setting to the QuakeReport App.

**Today's Progress**: Learning about data persistence in android.

**Thoughts** Learning about data persistence in android is a critical component of any app.
